Step 5: input: votesReiceived=10 votesToWin=50 opponentVotes=60 
        The opponent is supposed to win because its vote is more than the votestowin
        but the program assumes I win insted.

        input: votesReiceived=5  votesToWin=10  opponentVotes=9
        Neither of us should win it because both votes are less than the votes need to win
        but the program also assumes that I win.


Step 6: make the pctYou= 40.0 * votesReceived / votesToWin, so it is not equal to
        the % of the votes need to win and the result will be incorrect although the 
        input is correct. 

Step 7: there are two types of compile errors in the code. 
        First is that the variable opponentVotes is not declared, so the code will not 
        run
        Second is that there is only one bracket at the end, so there is not a header 
        in the code.
